      <b>Personal Statement:</b>
      I have deep experience in the design and operation of instrumentation for industrial controls and scientific experiments, starting from my teenage years when I built my first computer at the age of about 16, worked for an electronics business as a circuit designer, and designed and built a physics experiment at the age of 18. The latter, incorporating automated image processing, won me the first prize at the national level at the German science fair "Jugend Forscht". Electronic/optical/mechanical design also were important aspects of my physics training leading to a diploma thesis and PhD thesis in the field of x-ray physics. For the next 20+ years, I worked on synchrotron-radiation beamlines at national laboratories in Germany and the U.S., using the intense x-rays for experiments in x-ray quantum optics, x-ray spectroscopy and diffraction, and in experiments combining intense pulsed lasers with synchrotron x-rays. The synchrotron-beamline work gave me excellent training in the design and operation of complex instrumentation with high reliability requirements. Since the year of 2015, I am working for a high-tech company specializing in the production of a large-area picosecond-timing photon detector, and in parallel, I am operating a small business specializing in custom design of scientific instrumentation.
