    Dragonfly Devices, founded in 2013, is a small business (sole-proprietorship)
    based in the Chicagoland area.
    <br>
    The business focuses on the design and prototyping of custom electronics,
    mainly fast digital and microwave-frequency electronics, but also
    motor-control, high-voltage electronics, and precision optics.
    The owner, Dr. Bernhard Adams, is a physicist working in the fields
    of laser and x-ray optics.
    Examples of past and on-going design work are:
    <br>
    circuit boards for signal pickup and amplification from a Large-Area
    Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD, <u><a class="text-blue-104" href="https://psec.uchicago.edu">psec.uchicago.edu</a></u>)
    <br><br>
    custom electronics for the control of a laser-driven x-ray source
    <br>
    a four-axis controller for DC servo motors with encoder feedback
    <br>
    a software system named PIIICO for controlling physics experiments and
    acquiring data
    <br><br>
    Dragonfly Devices (DD) is affiliated with <u><a class="text-blue-104" href="http://qoar.co">Quantum Optics Applied Research</a></u>
    (QOAR), a sole proprietorship by the same owner, and Talos Precision,
    jointly with Martin Adams.
    These business entities pursue complementary activities, DD being set up
    for opto-electronic hardware design, QOAR for scientific consulting, and
    Talos for the design, manufacture, and sale of precision motion stages
    and CNC machines.
